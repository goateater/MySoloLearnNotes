# Sets

# Sets are data structures, similar to lists or dictionaries.
# They are created using curly braces, or the set function.
# They share some functionality with lists, such as the use of in to check whether they contain a particular item.

num_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
word_set = set(["spam", "eggs", "sausage"])

print(3 in num_set)
print("spam" not in word_set)

# To create an empty set, you must use set(), as {} creates an empty dictionary.
# Key:Value pairs are contained by Dictionaries, whereas sets are just a bunch of Values alone.

# Example of another set
print()
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {1, 2, 2, 3}
set3 = {3, 2, 2, 1}
set4 = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}

print(set1)
print(set2)
print(set3)
print(set4)

if set1 == set3:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)

if 'c' in set4:
    print(type(set4))
    print(True)
else:
    print("set 4 contains the strings of a, b, c and d")

# SET is a collection of unique values, duplicate ones are ignored.
newset = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}
newset.add(6)
print(newset)
newset.remove(3)
newset.pop()
print(newset)

# LISTS: [], mutable, indexed
# TUPLES: (), immutable, indexed
# DICTIONARY: {key value pairs}, unordered, mutable, don't use an index, instead they use a key which must be arbitrarily defined.
# SETS: {}, unordered so they cannot be indexed.

print()

print("Options available in sets:\n", dir(set))

print()

# Sets differ from lists in several ways, but share several list operations such as len.
# They are unordered, which means that they can't be indexed.
# They cannot contain duplicate elements.
# Due to the way they're stored, it's faster to check whether an item is part of a set, rather than part of a list.
# Instead of using append to add to a set, use add.
# The method remove removes a specific element from a set; pop removes an arbitrary element

nums = {1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6}
print(nums)
nums.add(-7)
nums.remove(3)
print(nums)

# Basic uses of sets include membership testing and the elimination of duplicate entries.

# using .pop with a list of integers
nums = {1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6}
while len(nums) > 0:
    nums.pop();
    print(nums)

print("\n")

# using pop with a string (converting from integers)
nums = {1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6}
str1 = ''.join(str(e) for e in nums)
while len(nums) > 0:
    nums.pop();
    print(nums)
print("\n")

# using pop with a string (backup incase the above code didn't work)
nums = {'1', '2', '1', '3', '1', '4', '5', '6'}
while len(nums) > 0:
    nums.pop();
    print(nums)

# Sets can be combined using mathematical operations.
# The union operator | combines two sets to form a new one containing items in either.
# The intersection operator & gets items only in both.
# The difference operator - gets items in the first set but not in the second.
# The symmetric difference operator ^ gets items in either set, but not both.

print()

first = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
second = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

print(first & second)
print(first - second)
print(second - first)
print(first ^ second)


# Data Structures

# As we have seen in the previous lessons, Python supports the following data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets.

# When to use a dictionary:
# - When you need a logical association between a key:value pair.
# - When you need fast lookup for your data, based on a custom key.
# - When your data is being constantly modified. Remember, dictionaries are mutable.

# When to use the other types:
# - Use lists if you have a collection of data that does not need random access. Try to choose lists when you need a simple, iterable collection that is modified frequently.
# - Use a set if you need uniqueness for the elements.
# - Use tuples when your data cannot change.

# Many times, a tuple is used in combination with a dictionary, for example, a tuple might represent a key, because it's immutable.


# ** NOTE **
# There are currently two built-in set types, set and frozenset.

# The set type is mutable â€” the contents can be changed using methods like add() and remove().
# Since it is mutable, it has no hash value and cannot be used as either a dictionary key or as an element of another set.

# The frozenset type is immutable and hashable
# Its contents cannot be altered after it is created; it can therefore be used as a dictionary key or as an element of another set.
